[![Dependencies Status](https://jarkeeper.com/amalloy/useful/status.svg)](https://jarkeeper.com/amalloy/useful)

![lein dependency](https://clojars.org/org.flatland/useful/latest-version.svg)

These two repositories are usually identical:

* https://github.com/amalloy/useful
* https://github.com/flatland/useful

The first is the canonical one.  Fixes tend to appear there first, and
that is the preferred repository for filing issues on Github.  Fixes
are backported to the second one periodically.
